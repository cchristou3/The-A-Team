• What specific aspects will they test? <br>
Usability,design,user-friendly,responsive design and for defects(bugs).
1.Visibility of system status->Our app complies this requirement
2.Match between system and the real world->
3.User control and freedom->Our app complies this requirement(with a back button)
4.Consistency and standards->Our app complies this requirement
5.Error prevention->Our app complies this requirement (with alert-box,prompt-box and our buttons are big enough)
6.Recognition rather than recall->Our app complies this requirement(also with a help button)
7.Flexibility and efficiency of use->
8.Aesthetic and minimalist design->
9.Help users recognize,diagnose, and recover from errors-> Our app complies this requirement all the alerts are in plain language and suggesting solutions
10.Help and documentation->

Produce a test plan to address the following questions: <br>
• Who is going to test your app? <br>
All the members of our team and professors,possible all the rest of our classmates and random users through the social media
• When will they do the testing? <br>
While working on the app and when it will be released.

• How will the results be recorded? <br>
It will be recorded on the table.

• What happens when a defect (bug) is discovered? <br>
We assign someone of our team to fix it or at least improve it.

Some problems our team faced:
Problem1: When clicking on a treasure hunt the form application did not appear and the app navigated to the wrong website
Assigned person: Charalambos
Result: problem solved, used correct css properies and changed the https request link


Problem2: The app did not save the session of the tresure hunt properly, resulting into the questions not loading
Assigned person: Antonis
Result: problem solved, added cookie functions


Problem3: Blurry background, not easy to read the text overall, buttons too small
Assigned person: Christodoulos
Result: problem solved, lots of css properties changed


Problem4:The app asks the user for location each time a question appears, even when it does not appear
Assigned person: Charalambos
Result: problem solved, changed the flow of the javascript


• How is the defect allocated to the right person? <br>
According to the type of the defect it will be assigned to the person that is responsible for that case(Design for Christodoulos,JavaScript for Charalambos and or Antonis).

• How will you trigger re-testing of the code?<br>
We will create a table with the expected outputs comparing them to the one's that we have as output.
